        The company is continuously identifying and developing profitable investment opportunities to transform
        communities through job creation and capacity development. We invest in businesses that can deliver
        strong earnings and capital growth over the long term. Our investments are made directly or through
        subsidiaries and related companies that cut across a broad range of industries such as construction,
        real estate, oil & gas, aviation, telecommunication, and manufacturing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-14 md:text-16 mb-5">
        The leadership team is made up of professionals and astute entrepreneurs with several years of investment
        and management experience in multiple industries.
      </p>
      <p class="text-14 md:text-16 mb-5">
        Our investment philosophy is anchored on the long-term fundamentals, preferring to grow organically as well as through acquisitions in areas where
        we are able to leverage our significant experience and capabilities to create value. The Company predominantly
        uses its equity capital for investment which promotes favourable financing flexibility and swift decisions at the
        early stages of investment.
